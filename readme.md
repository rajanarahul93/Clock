# Beautiful Clock Project

üï∞Ô∏è Welcome to the Beautiful Clock Project! This project is a result of my participation in the 14-Day CSS Challenge, where I embraced creativity and honed my CSS skills to craft a visually appealing and dynamic clock.

## Project Overview

The Beautiful Clock is a web-based clock with stunning visuals and animated elements. The design includes a responsive layout, captivating background gradients, and lively animations for the hour, minute, and second hands. Additionally, the clock face pulsates, adding a touch of elegance to the overall experience.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Ensures a seamless display across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Gradient Background Animation:** The background smoothly transitions through captivating gradients.
- **Clock Hands Animation:** Smooth rotations for the hour, minute, and second hands, adding a dynamic element.
- **Pulsating Clock Face:** The clock face pulsates with a subtle heartbeat effect, enhancing the visual appeal.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML:** Provides the structural foundation for the project.
- **CSS:** Handles styling and animations, adhering to the challenge's no-prebuilt-templates rule.
